## Project Details

**Project Name:** [Code Lab Connect](https://github.com/Anirudhakale98/Code-Lab-Connect)

### Description

Developed an innovative platform for college lab assignment submissions with an integrated code editor. The platform allows students to write, run, and submit code directly on the website. The submissions are stored in a database and can be reviewed by teachers, who can then assign grades. The system supports two user roles: students and teachers. Students can submit coding assignments for various subjects, and teachers can review these assignments and provide feedback and marks.

### Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development.
- Enhanced understanding of creating and managing user roles and permissions.
- Developed skills in integrating a code editor into a web platform.
- Learned efficient database management and data storage techniques.
- Improved knowledge of server-side scripting and handling client-server interactions.
- Acquired experience in building and deploying a scalable web application.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, MUI (Material UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **API:** JDoodle (for compiling and running code)
- **Authentication:** JWT

## Features

- Role-based access for students and teachers.
- Integrated code editor for writing and running code.
- Secure code submission and database storage.
- Teacher review and grading system.
- User authentication and session management.
